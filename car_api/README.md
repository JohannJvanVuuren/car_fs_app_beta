### 1. Introduction

This is a full stack React/Express application built to experiment with combining of the two technologies to create a fully functional web application. 

### 2. Installation

The application needs requires dependency installation on both the backend and frontend.  

Change directory to the root folder of the project which is called car_api and run  

`yarn install`  

Then change directories to car_api/frontend and run the compand again:  

`yarn install`  

At this point the dependencies should all be in place and the installation is completed.  

### 3. Usage

To run the application a similar process is needed to that used in the installation. The server should be started by changing into the root directory car_api and running the command:  

`yarn start`

The React frontend should then be started by changing into the directory car_api/frontend and running the command:  

`yarn start`

Once started the following landing page will appear and navigation takes place via the navigation buttons at the top of the page.
